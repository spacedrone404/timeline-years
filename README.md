Chronological timeline rendered via plain JS/CSS.
<br>
Written from scratch in Windows 7 x64 / VSCodium 1.93.
<br>

Main features:

- Lightweight: no frameworks used, pure code
- Adaptive design: desktop & mobile
- Smooth resizing & interactive animations

Timeline slides can be changed using of multiple inputs:

- GUI interactions [dots, arrow buttons, clicks]
- keyboard arrows [left/right/up/down]
- mouse wheel [up/down]
- touchscreen swipes

Mobile layout styling is a bit hackerish right now.
<br>
Non standard breakpoints, negative margins/coordinate transformations doesn't look neat, got to fix that.
<br>
Extended animations are planned in the upcoming future.
<br>
More to come! Maybe.... somebody give me an ability not to sleep!.
